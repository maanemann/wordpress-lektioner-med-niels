Wordpress seems pretty cool, despite the presumptions i had about it being just for people who want a quick blog with a premade template. But that's just wordpress.com giving it a bad rep i guess. Or maybe "a bad rep" is not quite accurate for the most used CMS in the world (isn't it?). Okay, this will make a good readme file.
